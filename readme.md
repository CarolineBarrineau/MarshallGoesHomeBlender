# Blender 3D Models and Desings for Marvelous Adventures of Marshall
#### Raccoon 3D model has walking and "idle" animation, bones, material color, and .fbx file as a game object
#### Turtle has just the 3D model
# How to Use
#### Drag and drop the blender file into an updated version of Unity 
#### currently 'scene' is the walking animation, right clicking on the model icon will bring up its inspection properties
#### click edit from there to rename the scene 
#### add an animator controller component
#### by editing the blender file, it will save under the Unity file, not any downloaded file, so make sure to save as if you make changes and want to view it separately later
